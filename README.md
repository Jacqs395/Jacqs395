## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am trying something new, pivoting from real estate and education, to Data Science.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Data Science Fellowship with The Knowledge House. Eager to merge my background in communications, real estate & education with data science, & contribute to impactful change in our community.

ðŸŒ± I am learning Python and, basically, everything there is to know about coding.
